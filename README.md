# Hand Sign Detection

Hand Sign Detection is a computer vision project that recognizes and classifies different hand gestures or signs using machine learning models. This project can be applied in areas like sign language interpretation, gesture-based controls, and gaming interfaces.

## Features

- **Real-time Hand Sign Recognition:** Detect and classify hand signs from video or live camera feeds.
- **Pre-trained Models:** Utilizes machine learning models for recognizing common hand gestures.
- **Customizable Sign Sets:** Easily extend the model to recognize additional hand signs.
- **Cross-Platform:** Supports TensorFlow, OpenCV, and other deep learning libraries.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **OpenCV** – For real-time video capture and image processing.
- **TensorFlow/Keras** – For building and training deep learning models.
- **MediaPipe** – For hand landmark detection and tracking.
- **NumPy** – For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** – For visualizations and model performance analysis.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xavihachem/Hand-Sign-Detection.git
   cd Hand-Sign-Detection
